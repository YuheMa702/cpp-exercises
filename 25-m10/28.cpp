    I had not replied to her last message yet cuz I was quite puzzled by it and don't know what to say.
    Basically she was saying I should get myself a date since I am so romantic and knows how to please a girl.
    Well, what does that mean? Was she trying me to push me away by suggesting that I should go after other girls
    or was she checking if I also have flirted with other girls or was she encouraging me to confess my love for her?
    Or she was just being nice and did not mean anything by saying them.
    Women are so hard to read.
    Also I joined a AI CPU design tech talk this noon and was inspired by it.
    There are so much to learn and I feel like I know nothing.
