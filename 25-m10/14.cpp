    Damn my heart is beating so fast I cannot breath!!!!
    What have I done??? Did I just wrote a goofy never ending recursive good night function
    and send it to her?! Would it be too obvious?? I even added a blue heart after
    stack overflow comment I feel so stupid I don't know how she is gonna react to it.
    She probably has not seen it yet because her notifications might be muted!
    I feel like there is no turning back, that was toooo obvious!!!!
    That was very close to confessing my love to her!!!!
    Damn she says hahahahahaha, what does that mean!????
    Ok she probably did not see the hidden meanings behind the function.
    Probably or did she? I don't know! It's too hard to guess!
    OK I think she thought it was just a creative good night message.
    Anyway that was a HUGE step for me!!!!
